# Hey, I’m Hillary 👋

Product designer turned builder.  
I like turning messy ideas into things that actually ship, with the help from AI.

I build by solving **one real pain point at a time**, learning in public, and caring a lot about how things feel to use.

## What I’m About 🧩

- Designer → Design Engineer → Builder (yes, self-taught)
- I ship production apps, not just pretty prototypes
- I use AI as a thinking partner, not a magic button
- Strong bias toward doing, learning, and iterating

I believe the fastest way to grow is to build things that people actually use.

## A Bit of Background 🌍

I’ve worked on products across health tech, fintech, community platforms, telecom, and now faith-based tools.

Some highlights:
- Helped redesign key journeys in a fintech marketplace that led to a **1700% conversion increase**
- Scaled a community platform from **20k to 70k+ users**
- Designed for large-scale products, including one with **17M+ monthly active users**

I’ve lived, studied, and worked across **Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam**, so building for diverse users feels natural to me.

## What I’m Building Right Now 🚧

### 🌱 Waymark (main focus)
**Status:** In progress, beta soon  
**Website:** https://www.getwaymark.app  

Waymark is a modern guide that helps people understand God’s Word in the context of everyday life.

It’s for:
- Curious seekers who feel overwhelmed or intimidated  
- People returning to faith after a long break  
- Anyone who feels spiritually stuck and wants clarity, not pressure  

My goal is to make faith feel more approachable, grounded, and human.

### 🧭 TripLuvora (experimental)
A side project that started with a simple question:  
“What if finding where to stay felt like getting advice from a well-traveled friend?”

It’s on pause for now, but it continues to shape how I think about personalization and discovery.

---

## What I’m Learning 📚

Right now I’m focused on building **real, production-ready apps**, not tutorials:

- React Native
- Expo
- Next.js
- Framer Motion
- Supabase

Tool I’m enjoying the most lately: **Cursor**  
It feels like pair-programming, minus the awkward silence.

## How I Think About Building 🧠

- Solve real problems, even if they start small
- Learn by building, not waiting until you feel “ready”
- Focus on what you can control, leave the rest
- Progress beats perfection every time

---

## Fun Facts ✨

- Started in graphic design, moved into product design, now building end-to-end
- Very comfortable jumping into unfamiliar industries
- Used to adapting to new countries and cultures
- Actively planning my next international move
