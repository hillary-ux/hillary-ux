# Hi, I’m Hillary 👋

Product designer → builder, focused on building the right way with the help of AI.

I design, prototype, and ship digital products by solving **one real pain point at a time**.  
My work sits at the intersection of product thinking, engineering, and practical execution.

## 👩‍💻 What I Do

- Product Designer turned Design Engineer / Builder  
- Build production-ready apps, not just prototypes  
- Use AI as a thinking partner, not a shortcut  
- Strong bias toward shipping, learning, and iterating  

I believe the best way to learn is by building, and the best products are grounded in real human problems.

## 🚧 What I’m Building Now

### 🌱 Waymark (Primary Focus)
**Status:** In progress, beta soon  
**Website:** https://www.getwaymark.app  

A modern guide that helps people understand God’s Word through daily life.

**Who it’s for**
- New Christians or seekers who feel curious but overwhelmed  
- Returning Christians or those feeling spiritually stuck  

Waymark lowers the cognitive and emotional barrier to faith through clarity, empathy, and real-life application.

### 🧭 TripLuvora (Experimental)

A travel concept that helps people find neighborhoods that match their vibe, like getting advice from a well-traveled friend instead of a generic hotel search.

Currently on hold, but it continues to influence how I think about personalization and discovery.
